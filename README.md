This python program can be used for finding out the temperature(both in Celcius and Fahrenheit) and weather of a city of your choice.

In order to do that, you would first require an API key.
This can be accessed by going to the openweathermap site ('https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in')and creating an account.
Through this, you can access your very own API code which can be then entered.

Now you can type in the city of your choice.
The program will then display the temperature of the entered city both in degree celcius and fahrenheit.
It also displays the weather forecsat by using the all-too-familiar weather emojis.
